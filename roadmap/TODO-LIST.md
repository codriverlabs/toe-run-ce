## 🔴 High Priority - Pending

### 1. E2E Testing Infrastructure
**Status**: Not Started  
**Effort**: 2-3 weeks

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Set up envtest-based E2E tests for controller logic
- [ ] Implement Kind-based E2E tests for actual pod profiling
- [ ] Add test cases for:
  - [ ] PowerTool lifecycle (create/update/delete)
  - [ ] Multi-container pod targeting
  - [ ] Non-root pod profiling
  - [ ] runAsRoot feature validation
  - [ ] Conflict detection
  - [ ] Output modes (ephemeral, PVC, collector)

**Current Coverage**: 72.4% (Controller)  
**Target Coverage**: 80%+

**Gaps to Address**:
- [ ] Collector Server (46.5% → 70%+)
  - [ ] `Start()` function coverage
  - [ ] `Shutdown()` function coverage
  - [ ] `handleProfile()` success paths
  - [ ] Token validation mocking
- [ ] Auth Module (0% → 70%+)
  - [ ] Token generation tests
  - [ ] Token validation tests
  - [ ] K8s client mocking
- [ ] Controller edge cases
  - [ ] Namespace selector logic
  - [ ] Conflict detection scenarios
  - [ ] Error handling paths

**Why Important**: Higher coverage = fewer production bugs

  - [ ] Queue depth
- [ ] Create Grafana dashboards
- [ ] Add structured logging with levels
- [ ] Implement distributed tracing

**Why Important**: Better visibility into system behavior

---

### 6. Security Enhancements
**Status**: Not Started  
**Effort**: 1-2 weeks

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement Pod Security Standards compliance
