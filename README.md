## Description
// TODO(user): An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.24.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster

**Configure Image Pull Secrets (for private registries):**

If you're using private container registries (like ECR), configure image pull secrets:

```sh
# Configure the operator deployment to use your image pull secret
./configure-image-pull-secrets.sh your-ecr-secret-name

# Create the secret in your cluster (example for ECR)
kubectl create secret docker-registry your-ecr-secret-name \
  --docker-server=123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com \
  --docker-username=AWS \
  --docker-password=$(aws ecr get-login-password --region us-west-2) \
  --namespace=toe-system
```

**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/toe:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified.
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment.
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands donâ€™t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/toe:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### Using Private Container Registries

If your profiler images are stored in private registries (like ECR), configure image pull secrets at the namespace level:

```sh
# Setup ECR access for target pods in a specific namespace
./setup-namespace-secrets.sh default 123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com us-west-2

# This will:
# 1. Create the ECR secret in the target namespace
# 2. Configure the default service account to use the secret
# 3. All pods in that namespace will inherit ECR access
```

Then use ECR images in your PowerTool:

```yaml
apiVersion: codriverlabs.ai.toe.run/v1alpha1
kind: PowerTool
metadata:
  name: my-powertool
spec:
  targets:
    labelSelector:
      matchLabels:
        app: my-app
  tool:
    name: "aperf"  # Image resolved from operator's ConfigMap
    duration: "30s"
  output:
    mode: "ephemeral"
```

The profiler tool name is mapped to specific Docker images via a ConfigMap that only the operator can access, ensuring security and version control.

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Project Distribution

Following the options to release and provide this solution to the users.

### By providing a bundle with all YAML files

1. Build the installer for the image built and published in the registry:

```sh
make build-installer IMG=<some-registry>/toe:tag
```

**NOTE:** The makefile target mentioned above generates an 'install.yaml'
file in the dist directory. This file contains all the resources built
with Kustomize, which are necessary to install this project without its
dependencies.

2. Using the installer

Users can just run 'kubectl apply -f <URL for YAML BUNDLE>' to install
the project, i.e.:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/toe/<tag or branch>/dist/install.yaml
```

### By providing a Helm Chart

1. Build the chart using the optional helm plugin

```sh
kubebuilder edit --plugins=helm/v1-alpha
```

2. See that a chart was generated under 'dist/chart', and users
can obtain this solution from there.

**NOTE:** If you change the project, you need to update the Helm Chart
using the same command above to sync the latest changes. Furthermore,
if you create webhooks, you need to use the above command with
the '--force' flag and manually ensure that any custom configuration
previously added to 'dist/chart/values.yaml' or 'dist/chart/manager/manager.yaml'
is manually re-applied afterwards.
